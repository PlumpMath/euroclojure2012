This presentation discusses the compojure-rest library. Since the EuroClojure 2012 this has been renamed to _Liberator_ and can be found at https://github.com/ordnungswidrig/liberator and https://github.com/malcolmsparks/liberator. 

At the time of writing we are still code-reviewing and merging code, so
please e-mail me directly and I'll let you know the current status.
